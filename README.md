## Installation

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Usage

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start Vite's development server, allowing you to view your application in the browser. Changes to your source files will trigger hot module replacement (HMR), providing a fast development experience.

### Production Build

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This command compiles your TypeScript code using TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) and then builds your application for production using Vite.

### Linting

To lint your TypeScript and React code, run:

```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```

This command uses ESLint with TypeScript support to analyze your code for potential errors and enforce code style conventions.

### Preview

To preview the production build locally, run:

```bash
npm run preview
# or
yarn preview
```

This will serve the production build of your application locally, allowing you to test it before deployment.
